# ds-algo

Data structures and algorithms

## Notes

- Tested on Python 3.8.5
- imports are based on absolute paths
- for VSCode users, use a `.env` file to store the `PYTHONPATH` variable

## Todo

### General

- implement docstrings
- formalize testing with unittest

### Graphs

- for BFS and DFS algorithms, output a list/iterator
- for graph classes, method for returning the DFS spanning tree, BFS spanning tree, and Minimum Spanning Tree
- parent method using DFS spanning tree
- Dijkstra for directed graphs

### Trees

- rank-based system to unify several different tree types
